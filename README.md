# Audio-based-Machine-Learning-MVP
Skills required:
- Machine learning
- Audio signal processing
- Python programming

This is a medium-sized project with an estimated duration of 1 month. The technical requirements are below:
1. Implement a basic pitch detection & note classification ML model using dataset of professional singer singing Bhupali raga (in scales A#, B, C, C#, D) & notes Sa, Re, Ga, Pa, Dha, Taar-sa (in scale A)
2. The Python program should be able to take a user's voice recording as input, use then ML model & then tell them which parts of their recording has areas of improvements in (for e.g. in a 5 seconds recording, tell them where the pitch was perfect, low or high)
3. The model should be able to take newer datasets & get re-trained to improve it for use over time
4. Samples professional of audio
==============================
To implement an audio-based machine learning model for pitch detection and note classification, we'll need to take several steps. The goal is to build a system that processes audio, detects the pitch of each note, classifies the note (e.g., Sa, Re, Ga, etc.), and identifies areas for improvement in a given user’s audio recording.
High-Level Steps:

    Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction: Extract audio features (e.g., spectrogram, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), pitch) that can be used for training the model.
    Pitch Detection and Classification: Develop an ML model to detect the pitch and classify it into musical notes (Sa, Re, Ga, etc.) for the given scale.
    Real-time Feedback: Analyze the user's voice recording and output feedback on pitch accuracy.
    Retraining: Implement functionality to improve the model by retraining it with new data over time.

Libraries and Frameworks:

    Librosa for audio signal processing and feature extraction.
    TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the machine learning model.
    NumPy for numerical operations.
    SciPy or Soundfile for handling audio input and output.
    Matplotlib for visualizing the results (optional).

Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Install Required Libraries

pip install librosa tensorflow numpy scipy soundfile matplotlib

Step 2: Preprocessing Audio and Feature Extraction

In this step, we will extract key audio features from the audio data, such as pitch and MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), which are widely used in speech and audio signal processing.

import librosa
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Function to extract pitch and MFCC from an audio file
def extract_features(audio_file):
    y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file, sr=None)
    
    # Extracting pitch using librosa's piptrack function
    pitches, magnitudes = librosa.core.piptrack(y=y, sr=sr)
    pitch = []
    for t in range(magnitudes.shape[1]):
        index = magnitudes[:, t].argmax()
        pitch.append(pitches[index, t])
    
    # Extracting MFCC features
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)

    # Taking the mean of the MFCCs and pitch
    pitch = np.mean(pitch)
    mfccs = np.mean(mfccs, axis=1)

    return pitch, mfccs

# Example usage
audio_file = 'path_to_audio_file.wav'
pitch, mfccs = extract_features(audio_file)
print(f"Detected pitch: {pitch}")

Step 3: Pitch and Note Classification

Now we need to classify the pitch into specific notes. The Bhupali Raga is a variant of the Hindustani classical music scale with the following notes: Sa, Re, Ga, Pa, Dha, and Taar-sa. To detect these notes, we will map the detected pitch to the closest note in the raga.

The pitch can be mapped to musical notes using frequency ranges. For example, the note Sa corresponds to around 440 Hz (in Western tuning).

Here's a simple example to classify the pitch into a note:

def classify_note(pitch):
    # Define pitch to note mapping (for simplicity, just a few notes)
    notes = {
        'Sa': (440, 466),  # A
        'Re': (466, 493),  # A#
        'Ga': (493, 523),  # B
        'Pa': (523, 554),  # C
        'Dha': (554, 587), # C#
        'Taar-sa': (587, 622) # D
    }
    
    # Find the note that the pitch falls into
    for note, (low, high) in notes.items():
        if low <= pitch <= high:
            return note
    return 'Unknown'

# Example usage
note = classify_note(pitch)
print(f"Detected note: {note}")

Step 4: Build a Simple Machine Learning Model

Now, let’s build a simple machine learning model using TensorFlow (you can use PyTorch if you prefer). We'll train the model using the extracted MFCC features to predict the note based on pitch.

Dataset Preparation:

    First, collect a dataset of audio files containing the notes of the Bhupali raga (Sa, Re, Ga, Pa, Dha, Taar-sa).
    Extract the features (MFCCs and pitch) for each file and label them with the corresponding note.

import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Create a dataset
audio_files = ['path_to_audio_1.wav', 'path_to_audio_2.wav', ...]  # Add your audio file paths
labels = ['Sa', 'Re', 'Ga', 'Pa', 'Dha', 'Taar-sa']  # Corresponding notes for each file

# Extract features from the audio files
features = []
for audio_file in audio_files:
    pitch, mfccs = extract_features(audio_file)
    features.append(np.concatenate([mfccs, [pitch]]))

# Convert features to numpy array
X = np.array(features)

# Label encoding
encoder = LabelEncoder()
y = encoder.fit_transform(labels)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build the neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(set(y)), activation='softmax')  # Number of notes
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

Step 5: Predicting Pitch Accuracy and Feedback

Once the model is trained, you can use it to provide feedback on a user’s recording. The system will analyze the user’s audio, detect the pitch, classify the note, and provide feedback on the accuracy of their performance.

def analyze_user_audio(user_audio_file, model, encoder):
    # Extract features from user input
    pitch, mfccs = extract_features(user_audio_file)
    features = np.concatenate([mfccs, [pitch]])

    # Predict the note
    prediction = model.predict(np.array([features]))
    predicted_note = encoder.inverse_transform([np.argmax(prediction)])

    # Provide feedback based on pitch accuracy
    note = classify_note(pitch)
    print(f"Predicted note: {predicted_note[0]}")
    print(f"Detected pitch: {pitch} Hz, which corresponds to {note}")

    # Feedback for pitch improvement (can be enhanced further)
    if note == predicted_note[0]:
        print("Pitch is accurate!")
    else:
        print(f"Pitch mismatch. You need to improve towards {predicted_note[0]}.")

# Example usage
user_audio_file = 'path_to_user_audio.wav'
analyze_user_audio(user_audio_file, model, encoder)

Step 6: Retraining the Model

To improve the model over time, you can periodically retrain it with new datasets. After collecting more data (e.g., new recordings or better labeled data), extract the features and re-train the model to improve its accuracy.
Final Thoughts:

This solution leverages machine learning (using TensorFlow or PyTorch) and audio processing (with Librosa) to detect pitch and classify notes for a given scale (Bhupali raga). The user’s performance can be evaluated in real-time, providing feedback on areas for improvement.

The key steps involved in building the MVP for this project include:

    Audio preprocessing and feature extraction.
    Building and training a machine learning model.
    Analyzing user recordings and providing feedback.

You can further enhance the system by improving the note classification, implementing more sophisticated pitch detection algorithms, and continuously retraining the model as new data is collected.
